# Mods
*Mods*, or modifications, are essential to the rhythm game experience. While many may consider them optional, a rhythm game is barely complete without them. Mods modify the chart or gameplay rules in various ways.

Each game has its own unique set of mods due to their different play styles, though some mods are universal and can be applied to any gamemode.

Mods are marked with symbols defining if they make play easier (-), harder ️(+), possibly both (≈), or no difficulty change (=).

## Universal Mods

### Mirror Mode (≈)

### Hidden Mode (+)
