# Charm
A Python-based rhythm engine. 

## What?
I'm just messing around. I want to get Clone Hero (and everything elses) `.chart` and `.mid` charts to load in it in some readable way, and playable. Later on, I want to add more types of rhythming. This likely won't feel good to play right away; it'll be 2D (for now) and made in PyGame (for now.) Hoping to make it versitile enough to slot in new types of chart later. Anywho, Charm!

## Chart formats I plan to support

* `.chart`, various guitar games
* `.mid` (chart), various guitar games, notably Frets on Fire
* `.osu` (mania), [osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu%21_File_Formats)
* `.sm`, [StepMania](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/StepMania/Creating_songs)
* `.bms`, [Lunatic Rave 2](https://github.com/BMS-Community/resources#bms-creation), a Beatmania iidx engine

## Why is it called Charm?
Like... snake charming? Music? It's the only word I could think of that had something to do with snakes and music.

## I hate you.
Fair.
